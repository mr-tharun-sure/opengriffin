**You wake up. Overnight, your agent has read yesterday back to itself, written down what it learned about you, caught its own failures, and proposed new skills — in a journal you can read over coffee.** That nightly self-improvement loop, built *natively* on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python) — real skills, MCP, hooks, resumable sessions, not a reimplementation — is what OpenGriffin is. It lives in your Telegram, runs entirely on your own machine, and works with any of 21 model providers on your own key.

## How it's different

The personal-agent space is crowded — Nous Research's **Hermes Agent**, **OpenClaw**, and **QwenPaw** all do self-evolving, multi-messenger, BYO-key, and local-first. OpenGriffin doesn't claim to out-feature them. Two things are genuinely ours:

1. **It's the Claude-native one.** OpenGriffin runs *on the Claude Agent SDK itself* — your skills are real Claude Code skills under `~/.claude/skills/` (shared with Claude Code), MCP servers, hooks, and resumable sessions all work as-is. The others reimplement an agent loop; OpenGriffin *is* the Claude loop, wearing a Telegram face.
2. **The journal is a readable, shareable artifact.** The nightly loop doesn't just mutate hidden state — it writes you a page you can read, and `griffin card` makes it shareable. "Learns while you sleep" you can actually *see*.

| | OpenGriffin | Hermes (Nous) | OpenClaw | QwenPaw |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Built **on** the Claude Agent SDK (native skills / MCP / hooks / sessions) | ✅ | ❌ own runtime | ❌ own runtime | ❌ Qwen / AgentScope |
| Readable nightly journal you can screenshot & share | ✅ `griffin card` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Telegram-native onboarding (one messenger, ~2 min) | ✅ | one of many | one of many | one of many |
| Self-evolving skills | ✅ | ✅ | ◑ | ✅ |
| Multi-messenger gateways | ✅ 7 | ✅ 7 | ✅ 20+ | ✅ 5 |
| BYO-key / multi-provider | ✅ 21 | ✅ (incl. 200+ via OpenRouter) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Local-first / no backend | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Acts proactively (cron / triggers) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ heartbeat | ✅ |

<sub>Comparison reflects publicly documented features as of mid-2026. Hermes, OpenClaw, and QwenPaw are excellent projects with far larger communities — this table is about *fit*, not size.</sub>

## Why OpenGriffin

- **Self-evolving skill graph.** The agent authors, edits, and retires its own skills at runtime. No redeploy. New capabilities ship inside a conversation.
- **Daily journal at 4:30 AM.** Every conversation, decision, and tool call is appended to a structured journal. A nightly self-improvement loop reads yesterday's entries, summarizes them, and proposes new skills — then `griffin card` renders the entry into a shareable image.
- **21 AI providers, BYO key.** Claude Max OAuth, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Azure, Gemini, Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Together, Fireworks, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, Perplexity, xAI, Bedrock, Cerebras, NVIDIA NIM, Lambda Labs, Novita, Ollama. Switch with one env var.
- **Persistent memory: MEMORY / USER / SOUL.** Three flat markdown files load fresh into every session. `MEMORY.md` is the environment, `USER.md` is the profile, `SOUL.md` is the voice.
- **Multi-surface.** Telegram is the front door, but the same brain answers via CLI, webhooks, and voice notes.
- **Skill auto-discovery.** Drop a markdown file into `~/.claude/skills/`, and the agent picks it up on next turn — no registry, no config.
- **Voice round-trip.** `faster-whisper` transcribes inbound voice notes; `edge-tts` speaks replies in the user's preferred neural voice.
- **Browser automation via Playwright MCP.** Screenshots, scraping, end-to-end clicks. The agent can drive a real Chromium.
- **Kanban built in.** Multiple agent workers claim, block, and complete tasks against a shared board. Long plans get parallelized.
- **Checkpoints + rollback.** Conversation snapshots survive crashes. The agent can replay or branch off any prior point.
- **Approval inline buttons.** Risky actions ask first via Telegram inline keyboards. Confirm or deny with a tap; nothing destructive runs unsupervised.

## The 12 killer features

| # | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Skill Hub** | Install community skills directly from GitHub URLs with license auto-check, signing, and reputation tracking by *outcome*, not stars. |
| 2 | **Echo Memory + Receipts** | Autobiographical hierarchical memory (vivid → recent → fading → ancient). Every recalled fact comes with a citation receipt like `[echo:vivid/2026-05-06:abc123]` linking back to the source session. |
| 3 | **Ambient Trigger Mesh** | Compose triggers from cron, webhook, or polled URLs → optional LLM yes/no predicate → skill or prompt action. The agent acts before you notice the problem. |
| 4 | **Agent Pods** | Multiple agent personas with distinct SOUL files but shared memory. Add them to a group chat, watch them debate, converge. |
| 5 | **Agentic Wallet (x402)** | The agent can pay for things — sandbox wallet + per-skill spending caps + Telegram inline-button approval. Pays only after you tap. |
| 6 | **Soul Sync** | Mines your past chats for writing voice (sentence length, contractions, recurring phrases). Builds a `VOICE.md` the agent uses to draft *as you*. |
| 7 | **Provider Routing Auctions** | Lightweight classifier scores each prompt 0–3, routes to cheapest tier that can answer. Heavy thinking goes to Claude Opus / o1; "summarize this" goes to Groq for $0.0001. |
| 8 | **Drift Detection** | Nightly scan of `USER.md` against recent journal entries. Flags contradictions: _"3 months ago you told me you hated meetings; today you scheduled five."_ |
| 9 | **Self-Healing Skills** | When a skill fails 3+ times in a week, the agent debugs it, proposes an updated `SKILL.md`, and asks for approval before applying. |
| 10 | **Skill Graph Strategy** | Reads your usage to recommend missing skills based on co-occurrence, flags never-used skills, and surfaces your top-used ones. |
| 11 | **Memory Receipts** | Every claim the agent makes can be traced. Tap a receipt token to see the exact session and turn that established the fact. |
| 12 | **Reputation Ledger** | Signed JSON-LD profile (`/u/<handle>`) showing task count, approval rate, specialties, authored skills. A2A-discoverable for agent-to-agent trust. |

The frontier modules — **Personal World Model**, **Living Twin**, **Verifiable Refusal Proofs + Provable Forgetting**, **Generative Live UI**, **Mesa-Cognition Supervisor**, **Capability-Scoped Skill Leasing**, **Personal Causal Layer**, and the **Adversarial Improvement Market** — ship in addition. See [docs/frontier.md](docs/frontier.md) for the design notes.

## Nightly auto-loops

Every night, OpenGriffin runs without prompting:

| Time | Job | What |
|---|---|---|
| 04:00 | Daily session reset | Archives sessions; preserves the next morning a fresh slate while keeping recall |
| 04:30 | Self-improvement | Reads yesterday's transcripts, consolidates `MEMORY` / `USER`, writes `JOURNAL.md`, suggests skills |
| 04:45 | Echo memory consolidation | Rolls older sessions up the time hierarchy (vivid → recent → fading → ancient) |
| 05:00 | Drift detection | Surfaces contradictions in user model / behavior |
| 05:15 | World model retrain | Rebuilds the personal forecast from the event log |
| 05:30 | Mesa-cognition report | Scores the agent's own behavior for drift signatures |
| 05:45 | Causal discovery | Walks the event log for new cause→effect proposals |
| Sun 05:00 | Voice card refresh | Re-extracts writing-voice profile from past week's chats |
| per-trigger | Ambient triggers | All cron-based triggers from `triggers.json` |

---

## Quick start

```bash
# One-line install (clones, runs uv sync, writes a launchctl/systemd unit)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManasaEdavalli-TharunSure/opengriffin/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/ManasaEdavalli-TharunSure/opengriffin.git
cd opengriffin
uv sync --all-extras
cp .env.example ~/.opengriffin/.env  # fill in TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS
uv run opengriffin doctor              # verify env + provider
uv run opengriffin run                 # start the bot
```

On first launch, OpenGriffin will:

1. Load `.env` from `~/.opengriffin/.env` (or `OPENGRIFFIN_HOME/.env` if you've overridden the path).
2. Detect available providers (Claude Max → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama).
3. Create `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, and a `JOURNAL.md` under `~/.opengriffin/memories/`.
4. Drop you into a chat where the agent can already use tools.

```bash
# Use a specific provider
OPENGRIFFIN_PROVIDER=openrouter opengriffin run

# Diagnose the install
opengriffin doctor

# Run the nightly self-improvement loop manually
opengriffin improve

# Turn last night's journal entry into a shareable card (SVG, + PNG with --png)
opengriffin card --png

# Migrate state from a prior agent runtime (see docs/migration.md)
opengriffin migrate from-hermes
```

## First-time setup — pick your messenger

OpenGriffin runs **the same brain** across 7 free-pricing platforms. You create the bot in whichever messenger you use, paste its credential into your local `.env`, and run the agent on your own machine. There is no hosted onboarding, no waitlist, no account — you own the keys, the data, and the process.

The shared steps for every gateway are:

1. Create a bot / account / app on the platform → get a credential.
2. Find your own user id / handle / phone number on the platform.
3. Add credential + allowed-users env vars to `~/.opengriffin/.env`.
4. (For some gateways) `pip install 'opengriffin[<gateway>]'` to pull the platform SDK.
5. `opengriffin doctor` then `opengriffin run`.

You also need **at least one model key** in `.env`. Any of these is enough:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...           # or OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY,
                                        # GROQ_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, …
OPENGRIFFIN_PROVIDER=anthropic          # must match the key you set
```

You can enable **multiple gateways at once** — the bot starts every gateway whose required env vars are present. They share one memory, one kanban, one set of MCP servers. See [Cross-platform identity](docs/gateways/index.md#cross-platform-identity) to link your accounts.

> ⚠️ Across every gateway: leaving the `*_ALLOWED_USERS` (or equivalent) env var **empty** makes the bot **open to anyone** who finds it. Set it to your own id while testing.

### Telegram

1. **Create the bot** — DM **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → pick display name → pick a username ending in `bot` → copy the `1234567890:AAH...` token.
2. **Get your user id** — DM **@userinfobot** anything; it replies with your numeric id (e.g. `987654321`).
3. **Configure** `~/.opengriffin/.env`:
   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:AAH...your-token-here
   TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=987654321       # your numeric user id
   TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=987654321        # default destination for cron + proactive messages
   ```
4. **Run** — `opengriffin doctor && opengriffin run`. Open your bot in Telegram, send `/start`, you'll see the command menu. `/whoami` confirms auth.

Optional BotFather steps while you're there: `/setprivacy` (Enable = DM/mention-only; Disable = sees all group messages), `/setdescription`, `/setuserpic`, `/setcommands` (or use the `setMyCommands` curl snippet in the detailed doc).

### Discord

1. **Create the bot** — go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → **New Application** → **Bot** tab → **Reset Token** → copy.
2. **Enable Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents (without this, the bot connects but never sees messages).
3. **Invite it to your server** — OAuth2 → URL Generator → scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`; permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Use Slash Commands`. Open the generated URL and pick your server.
4. **Get your user id** — enable Developer Mode (User Settings → Advanced), right-click your name → Copy User ID.
5. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=                     # from step 1
   DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=                 # comma-separated numeric user ids
   ```
6. **Install + run** — `pip install 'opengriffin[discord]'` then `opengriffin run`. DM the bot or @-mention it in a channel.

Discord caps messages at 2000 chars; OpenGriffin auto-splits longer replies. Voice channels and slash commands are not yet wired.

### Slack

Uses Slack Bolt **Socket Mode** — no public webhook URL needed.

1. **Create the app** — <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Create New App** → from scratch.
2. **App-Level Token** — Socket Mode → Enable → Generate App-Level Token with `connections:write` scope. Save the `xapp-...` token.
3. **Bot Token Scopes** under OAuth & Permissions: `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `app_mentions:read`.
4. **Event Subscriptions** → Enable → subscribe to bot events: `message.im`, `app_mention`.
5. **Install App to Workspace** — copy the bot token (`xoxb-...`).
6. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
   SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=                   # comma-separated Slack user ids; empty = open to workspace
   ```
7. **Install + run** — `pip install 'opengriffin[slack]'` then `opengriffin run`. DM the bot or @-mention it in any channel where it's been added.

Threading works automatically — replies stay in the thread they came from. Effective message limit is ~40k chars.

### Email (IMAP/SMTP)

Stdlib only — no extra deps. IMAP polling for inbound, SMTP for outbound. Great for long-form async work and webhook-driven inbound (Zapier/Make → email → bot).

1. **Get IMAP + SMTP credentials.** For Gmail/Workspace or iCloud (with 2FA on, which is the default), you need an **App Password**, not your account password:
   - Gmail: <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords> → create one for Mail; use the 16-character output.
   - iCloud: <https://account.apple.com/account/manage> → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords.
   - Other providers: usually IMAP 993 (SSL) + SMTP 587 (STARTTLS).
2. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
   EMAIL_IMAP_PORT=993
   EMAIL_IMAP_USER=you@example.com
   EMAIL_IMAP_PASS=app-password-here

   EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SMTP_USER=you@example.com        # defaults to IMAP_USER if blank
   EMAIL_SMTP_PASS=app-password-here      # defaults to IMAP_PASS if blank

   EMAIL_FROM_ADDR=you@example.com
   EMAIL_ALLOWED_SENDERS=trusted@example.com,boss@example.com
   ```
3. **Run** — `opengriffin run`. Email the bot from an allowed sender. Polling cadence is 60s (no IMAP IDLE in stdlib); threading is preserved via message-id chains.

### iMessage (macOS only)

Reads `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` directly; sends via AppleScript through Messages.app.

1. **Grant Full Disk Access** to your terminal: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → add Terminal.app / iTerm / whatever you launch the bot from. **Restart the terminal session** after granting.
2. **Grant Automation access** to Messages.app: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → your terminal → check Messages.
3. **Identify the handles** you'll allow — open a Messages.app conversation; the handle in the address bar (e.g. `+15551234567` or `you@example.com`) is what you'll list.
4. **Configure** (allowed handles are **required** — there is no open mode for iMessage):
   ```bash
   IMESSAGE_ALLOWED_HANDLES=+15551234567,boss@example.com
   IMESSAGE_DB_PATH=                              # default ~/Library/Messages/chat.db
   ```
5. **Run** — `opengriffin run`. The gateway polls `chat.db` every 3 seconds; replies appear as if they came from your iMessage account.

macOS only. Group chats are not yet supported.

### Matrix

Works with any Matrix homeserver — matrix.org (free public), self-hosted Synapse, Beeper, Element, etc. End-to-end encryption via Olm/Megolm is supported.

1. **Create a bot account** — easiest is to register a fresh username at <https://element.io> (e.g. `mybot:matrix.org`). For self-hosted Synapse, use `register_new_matrix_user`.
2. **(Optional) Get an access token** instead of storing the password — Element → Settings → Help & About → Advanced → Access Token. Saves you re-login.
3. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.org
   MATRIX_USER_ID=@mybot:matrix.org
   MATRIX_PASSWORD=                               # OR set MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN
   MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=
   MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS=@you:matrix.org,@boss:matrix.org
   ```
4. **Install + run** — `pip install 'opengriffin[matrix]'` (the `[e2e]` extra is included; drop it for plaintext-only) then `opengriffin run`. Open a DM with your bot's Matrix handle.

For E2E: the bot's device must be **verified** on first contact (click verify in Element), otherwise accept unverified sessions in your client settings. mautrix bridges to Telegram/Discord/Signal/WhatsApp work — the bot can sit in a bridged room.

### Signal

Hardest of the gateways — there's no public Signal API, so OpenGriffin wraps [`signal-cli`](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) which reverse-engineers the protocol. JVM-based; needs Java 21+.

1. **Install** — `brew install signal-cli` (macOS) or grab the release JAR from GitHub. Confirm Java 21+ with `java -version`.
2. **Register a phone number** that **isn't already on Signal** (Signal only allows one device per number for primary registration):
   ```bash
   signal-cli -a +15551234567 register
   signal-cli -a +15551234567 verify <code-from-sms>
   ```
   If you hit `Captcha required`, solve at <https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html> and pass `--captcha <url>`.
3. **Test sending manually** to confirm signal-cli works end-to-end:
   ```bash
   echo "test" | signal-cli -a +15551234567 send +15555555555
   ```
4. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   SIGNAL_NUMBER=+15551234567                     # the bot's number
   SIGNAL_ALLOWED_NUMBERS=+15555555555,+15556666666
   ```
5. **Run** — `opengriffin run`. First message after a quiet period can lag a few seconds (JVM cold start).

If signal-cli pain outweighs the value, use **Matrix** with the Signal bridge instead.

### After your bot is running

Once any gateway is up:

- Send `/start` (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Matrix) or any plain message (Email/iMessage/Signal) — you should get a typing indicator and a reply.
- `/whoami` — confirms the gateway recognised your user id.
- `/model openai gpt-4o-mini` — per-chat provider switch.
- `/journal` — shows today's auto-journal entry. (`griffin card` renders it into a shareable image.)
- `/usage` and `/insights` — token and cost breakdown across providers.

Full command reference, voice support, group-chat behavior, and per-gateway troubleshooting live in **[docs/gateways/](docs/gateways/)** — one file per platform.

## Skills

Skills are markdown files with frontmatter. The agent reads them on demand and can also write new ones during a conversation.

```markdown
---
name: morning-briefing
description: Compile calendar + journal + weather into a 5-line digest.
trigger: /briefing OR mornings at 7:30 AM
---

1. Pull today's calendar from Google.
2. Read the last journal entry.
3. Grab weather for the user's location.
4. Format as 5 lines, no preamble.
```

The agent decides when a skill is relevant. Users can invoke them with `/skill-name`. The `self_improve` module governs creation, editing, and deletion — every change is journaled.

## Built by itself

This README, the [JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md), the landing site at [apps/web](apps/web), and the [dashboard module](src/opengriffin/dashboard/server.py) were drafted by a running OpenGriffin instance.

The audit trail is in [dogfood/](dogfood/):

- **Kanban tasks.** [`dogfood/kanban.json`](dogfood/kanban.json) records each artifact — created, claimed, blocked, completed — with timestamps and the worker's session ID.
- **Journal entries.** [`dogfood/journal/`](dogfood/journal/) holds the daily log entries the agent wrote while working. They include tool calls, file diffs, and the agent's own reasoning.

A self-authored repo where you cannot trace the work back to a real run is not dogfooding, it's marketing. The chain of evidence is intentional.

## Contributing

We welcome PRs of every size — typo fixes, new providers, new tools, new skills. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

- Local dev setup (`uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`).
- The skill authoring guide.
- How to add a new provider (a short dict entry for OpenAI-compatible ones).
- The PR review bar (tests + a journal entry from a real session showing it works).

If you are unsure whether something is in-scope, open a discussion first — the project is opinionated about staying small at the core.
