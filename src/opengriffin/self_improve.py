"""Daily self-improvement loop.

Runs at 4:30am after the 4am reset. Has the bot review its own state
through a Claude session and:

  1. Append a journal entry to ~/.opengriffin/memories/JOURNAL.md
     (yesterday's summary — what happened, what worked, what failed).
  2. Consolidate MEMORY.md / USER.md if near cap (merge dupes, drop stale).
  3. Surface failures from yesterday's session transcripts.
  4. Suggest new skills it could create from observed patterns.
  5. Tag any in-progress kanban tasks that have stalled.
  6. Cap JOURNAL.md to last 90 entries to keep it bounded.

Designed to be IDEMPOTENT — safe to run twice in a day, won't double-write.

SELF_IMPROVE_PROMPT = """\
You are running the daily self-improvement turn for a Telegram bot. Today's date: {today}. \
Yesterday: {yesterday}.

Your job is to review yesterday's activity and improve the bot's persistent state. Be terse \
and structured. Use the tools you have access to (memory_*, session_search, kanban_*, \
skill_*, image_generate, cronjob_*, send_message). Do NOT message the user — your output \
goes to a log.

REQUIRED STEPS, in order:

1. **Recap**: use `session_search` to look at yesterday's conversations (search a few likely \
substrings if useful, or just sample recent sessions). Build a 3-5 line recap of what \
happened, what got done, and what the user seemed to care about.

2. **Memory hygiene**: read MEMORY.md and USER.md from the system prompt block. If either \
is over 80% of its cap, use `memory_replace` and `memory_remove` to consolidate (merge \
similar entries, drop stale items, prefer the most recent durable facts). Stop when both \
are under 70%.

3. **Persist new lessons**: from yesterday's recap, add any NEW durable facts via \
`memory_add` — user preferences to USER, environment/project facts to MEMORY. No duplicates.

4. **Failure surface**: search for "Error:" / "failed" / "timeout" in recent sessions. List \
each genuine failure (not transient network blips) in the journal and assign a severity \
{{low|med|high}}. If high-severity, mention it explicitly.

5. **Skill suggestions**: if you see a workflow that recurred 3+ times in recent sessions \
or could plausibly recur, propose a NEW skill name + 1-line description. Don't create the \
skill — just propose it. The user will approve.

6. **Kanban check**: list any kanban tasks in 'doing' status older than 48 hours. Flag them.

7. **Append journal entry**: at the END, write the journal entry to disk by calling the \
`journal_append` tool with a structured payload containing today's date and your findings. \
This is the only durable output of this turn.

Format the journal_append `entry` argument as compact markdown with these sections:
```
## {today}
**Recap:** <3-5 lines>
**Memory:** <one line: did you consolidate? added how many?>
**Failures:** <list each, one per line, or "none">
**Suggested skills:** <list or "none">
**Stalled kanban:** <list or "none">
**Notes:** <anything else worth remembering for tomorrow's self>
```

End your response with the literal token `<DONE>` so the harness knows you finished cleanly.
